    <string name="dream_01_01">On landing the role of Spiderman:\n
It\'s just about exploring and telling a story that
I\'ve cared about since I was 4 years old - that I
see as belonging to everyone and no one. I com-
pare it to how we don\'t get bored of seeing diff-
erent people play Hamlet, and we don\'t get bored
of seeing different people play King Lear. I consider
this role as the same kind of mythology as those
roles. There are modern myths, and I feel like this
is just another generation and a legacy that will
hopefully go on forever meaning so much to other
skinny boys throughout the ages.
